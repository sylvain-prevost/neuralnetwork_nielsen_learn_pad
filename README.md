# neuralnetwork_nielsen_learn_pad

Taking Nielsen book examples and map them as closely as possible onto Tensorflow.

Nielson book: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/
Tensorflow: https://www.tensorflow.org/

Using Python 3.5.2, NVidia Cuda 8.0, Tensorflow for windows

- Chapter 1 - complete
- Chapter 3 - incomplete / TBD : regularizations + SGD variations + alternate artificial neuron models
- Chapter 6 - TBD : conv layer + softmax layer




Note:

Tensorflow Windows install: excerpt from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/42#issuecomment-263645160

    you can install TensorFlow with a single command:

        C:\> pip install tensorflow

    For GPU support, if you have CUDA 8.0 installed, you can install the following package instead:

        C:\> pip install tensorflow-gpu
